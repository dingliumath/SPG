A python implementation of the spectral projected gradient (SPG) optimization method.

SPG is suited for optimizing differentiable real-valued multivariate functions
subject to simple constraints (namely, over a closed convex set)

The code is based on Mark Schmidt's minConf_SPG matlab implementation
http://www.di.ens.fr/~mschmidt/Software/minConf.html)

To test:
	python SPG_test.py

Supports:
- numerical differentiation
-
